# Tvshow

This project is a TV Show website which contains all the TV Shows based on Genres. You can also search for TV Shows, and get show details. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.0. The APIs used are available at [TVMAZE API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

## Further Updates
If I had more time I would have added/updated following things in the project:

1. Add More Features from the API, e.g. show Cast & Crew details on Details Page.
2. Make a better UI with Angular Material Integrated, also add dynamic pagination (Currently it only shows 5 TV Shows at a time for all size screens).
3. Added some more Unit testing which would've increased the coverage even more.
4. Added more type restrictions based on the API response. Create individual Custom Data types for each API response, so type errors are minimized much more.
